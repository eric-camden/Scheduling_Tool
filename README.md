# Scheduling_Tool
This JavaScript-based scheduling tool allows users to input and manage staff work schedules, automatically generating a visual heatmap and daily timetable based on entered shifts. It includes features like dark mode, CSV import/export, and time calculations (including carryovers past midnight) displayed in a clear, formatted HH:mm style.
